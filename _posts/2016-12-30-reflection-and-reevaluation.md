# All we can do is hope
(This is still a draft)

I promised 10 different people over the past 18 months that there was no way Donald Trump would finish his run for President. 

He'll drop out as soon as he loses a primary! 

The "real" Republicans will never let him win! 

The Evangelicals can't vote for him! 

There are way too many smart people in this country who will see through his rhetoric. 

Hillary has a few flaws, but the majority of people will vote for her.
