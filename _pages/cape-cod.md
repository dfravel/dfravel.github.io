# Where I live
Welcome to the Silicon Sandbar. Work where you live! Home of the Blue Economy.  

I bought a house in Cotuit in 1998 and have lived on the Cape since March of 1999. I've seen the rise, fall, rise again, stumble and reinvention of the Cape's white-collar economy. 

I know that 18 years isn't a great sample size, but my own employment path from "regular joe" employee at multiple companies, to business owner, to failed business owner to two-person development shop is a pretty good metaphor for the rest of the Cape's professional economy. Most of us could probably make a lot more money if we lived 45 miles up Route 3 (at least we'd have a few actual opportunities), but we've been convinced that living in paradise is a small price to pay for half the wages and paying out of pocket for health insurance.

Eventually, I'll move somewhere, but not in the next 10-15 years. I'd like to see my kids finish school and start their own lives. Until then I'll keep plugging away in my home office with Sue by my side.
