# What I do

Sue and I started [bluegear labs](http://bluegear.io) after I sold 20Mile Technologies ** 

Our Business model is simple - we develop websites, and write custom web applications. Sometimes we write our own applications. Sometimes we write applications for others. Most of the time we work in Laravel. The platform gives us a huge head start on the types of applications we write. It also helps that the community is incredibly supportive and there's a ton of resources available to us. 

If we're not writing an application with Laravel, we're probably developing a website for a client. Most of our recent sites have been done with [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com), but we still do some work with WordPress and ExpressionEngine. 

** At some point I should write about the process of attempting to build a company and then watching it crumble until I was forced to sell, but the pain is still too fresh even ~4 years later.
