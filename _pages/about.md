If you've made it to this page you obviously have too much free time or my name made the news in some horrific fashion and you need to get some basic background on me. Either way - welcome to my latest website. Over the past 10 years I've had a few different sites - nearly all of them are shuttered, sold or forgotten. I'd love to promise that I'll commit to writing on this site regularly, but if history has taught me anything it's that I have no idea what next week has in store for me. For now, I can promise to update this as often as possible on the topics that matter to me which are ... 

## Being a Dad

## My Partner

## Running

## My Job

#### About this site
I  didn't want to start posting to Medium.com like some gentrified Brooklyn douchebag. I _definitely_ didn't want "just another wordpress site". I have to deal with those pieces shit too much in my day-to-day job. I looked around at the million and seventeen content management systems. I played with Sculpin, Statamic, CraftCMS, OctoberCMS, PyroCMS and the latest ExpressionEngine. 

They're all great platforms with some wonderful people behind the scenes, but for this site I wanted to use something that I'll probably never use in my job. I decided on [Jekyll](http://www.jekyll.org){:target="_blank"} hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. The theme came from [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/){:target="_blank"}. It's available on [Github](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes){:target="_blank"}. For anyone who loves to write in Markdown, is familiar with GitHub and GitHub Pages, and isn't afraid of troubleshooting bundle errors, this is the static CMS for you.
